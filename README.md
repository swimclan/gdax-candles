# GDAX Candles

## Synopsis

GDAX Candles is a simple module used to stream numeric models of the GDAX cryptocurrency charts in candlestick form.  Users of this module can use this tool to get event-driven data models of price charts on the GDAX exchange.  

## Code Example

Installation and instantiation is very easy to get started.  Here is a basic usage example:

```js
const Chart = require('gdax-candles');

const product = 'ETH-USD';
const timeframe = '1m'; // supports second, minute and hour intervals (i.e. 1h, 30s, 10m, etc)
const accumulation = true; // Tell the module to collect all candles in memory (**WARNING** this is kind of a memory leak so only do this if you know what you are doing.  Set to false or dont specify it if you don't!)
const ethereumChart = new Chart({ product, timeframe, accumulation }).start();

ethereumChart.on('close', candle => {
  console.log(candle);
});

ethereumChart.on('change', candle => {
  console.log(candle);
});

console.log(ethereumChart.candles); // ==> An array of closed candlesticks: [{Candlestick}, {Candlestick}, ...]  If you set `accumulation` to false in Chart constructor then this will always be an empty array!!!
```

## Motivation

This module was created to help cryptocurrency traders to implement chart-based algorithmic trading strategies based on candlestick patterns.  With the numeric models of the candlesticks provided by this library, many quantitative trading strategies can be derived easily.  

## Installation

Installation into a Node project is as simple as:

```shell
npm i gdax-candles --save
```

## API Reference

See code example above.

## Tests

Will be implementing a testing framework when the module reaches a high level of popularity on npm
